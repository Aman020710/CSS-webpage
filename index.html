        <p class="lyrics-line">Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">Not knowing what it was</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">I will not give you up this time</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>
        <p class="lyrics-line">But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight </p>
